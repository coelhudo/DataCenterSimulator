Data Center Simulator
=====================

# Introduction

The ADCMSim (Autonomic Data Center Management Simulator) provides a
way to develop, evaluate, and validate Autonomic Computing\[1\] based
solutions in a Data Center environment.

The main ADCMSim components are:
* Physical layer to represent data center infrastructure from the IT perspective
* Computational layer to represent systems that will be running in the
IT infrastructure
* Autonomic Computing layer to manage Autonomic Managers and its
configuration and interactions

# Architecture

Currently three kinds of systems are available for evaluation:
* Interactive Systems
* Enterprise Systems
* HPC (High-performance Computing) Systems

Each system has a workload based on its characteristics. HPC for
example use batch jobs that will mimic intensive workload. Also, for
this initial version, there are two schedulers that can be configured.

The goals of the Autonomic Managers are described using high-level
policies. Currently two action policies are available:
* Green: its objective is maximize energy efficiency in the data center
* SLA (Service Level Agreement) Violation: its objective is minimize SLA Violations

The thermal model is based on the one from Arizona State University
\[2\]. Also, the cooler and its Coefficient of Performance (COP)
currently used in ADCMSim is one described by Hewlett-Packard (HP)
laboratories \[3\].

# Configuration

This project is using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for management.

Current dependencies are listed in the pom.xml file.

## Instruction

* *mvn compile* to compile :)
* *mvn exec:java* to execute Simulator Main class
* *mvn test* to execute units tests (and one integration test)
